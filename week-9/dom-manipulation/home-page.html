What did you learn about the DOM?

  The DOM is a representation of an HTML document as a tree, where its nodes correspond to HTML elements. This makes it more structured and allows other programs (written in JavaScript, JQuery, etc) to change the structure, style, or content.

What are some useful methods to use to manipulate the DOM?

  The most important methods are getElementById, getELementsByTagName, and getElementsByClassName, because without them you can't access the elements to manipulate them. Other useful methods are createElement and createEvent.
