**How does tracking and adding changes make developers' lives easier?**

**What is a commit?**
A commit is the way you save your work; it keeps a version of your current files/code. Then, if you ever make a change you don't like or that breaks your code, you can go back to a version from a previous commit instead of having to manually get rid of those changes.

**What are the best practices for commit messages?**
**What does the HEAD^ argument mean?**
**What are the 3 stages of a git change and how do you move a file from one stage to the other?**
**Write a handy cheatsheet of the commands you need to commit your changes?**
*git status* - tells you which files are tracked/untracked, which changes have been staged, which branch you're working on.
*git add .* - use to alert git that you have made changes (called "staging")
*git commit -m "commit message"* - creates a snapsnot of your files along with a message of what you have changed.
*git push* - sends the commit to a remote repository, i.e. Github

**What is a pull request and how do you create and merge one?**
**Why are pull requests preferred when working with teams?**
