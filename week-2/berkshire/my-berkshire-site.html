- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

    It was interesting, I had to look up some things to clarify once or twice (like relative paths & the structure of the img tag). The great thing about writing HTML is that while writing you can easily open the file in your browser, which is helpful to quickly check that everything is working properly (such as whether your images are showing up).

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

    It was a bit overwhelming at first, as there seem to be a lot of them. However, many of them are rather self-explanatory in what they are used for, which kept me from getting too lost when using them. HTML5 seems like a step up from previous versions, allowing for more specificity than using divs over and over again.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

    It was a bit frustrating at times. When I would open up the page in chrome to preview it, seeing it look so simple was a bit disappointing, and I wanted to be able to make it look nicer, but I understand that learning the basics of HTML is important before getting too distracted by formatting/styling.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

    The good is that it seems relatively easy to grasp, so far it hasn't been overly complicated, its just a matter of learning the different elements and when/how to use them.(Though I admit, if I try to look at the source HTML of established websites my eyes start to glaze over from how much there is.) The bad is that on its own, it's pretty boring, and you need to add CSS/Javascript to really flesh out a page.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

    When I start a new tag I always write the closing tag right after and then go back to fill in the content so that I don't forget to close it later. I think a big part of HTML is just keeping track of all the different elements available, and I always remember things better when I write them down, so I made myself a cheat sheet of the elements I know so far & what they're used for/what attributes they need. And since then I've written them out a couple times while telling myself out loud what they're for in order to memorize them.
