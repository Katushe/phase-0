**What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?**

The first phase is infor gathering, where you determine the purpose of the site, the goals of the site, the target audience, and what the content will be. The second phase is planning, where you develop a site map and decide what technologies to include. The third phase is design, where you decide on the look/feel of the site. The fourth stage is development, where you are creating the website itself and adding the functional elements. The fifth phase is testing & delivery, where you test the functionality, the compatability with different browsers, whether the code meets current web development standards, and upload the site to your server. The sixth phase is maintenance, which is ongoing and includes adding new content/products regularly, upgrading the technologies used, and installing additional plugins.

**What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?**

The primary purpose of the site is to attract potential employers. The site will feature the projects I am working on, my background & passions, and my blog.

**What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?**

Potential employers in the development industry will probably be most interested in what kind of projects I've worked on, so the portfolio part will be the biggest focus of the site.

**What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.**

The primary action would be to look through my portfolio, and then based on whether they like what's in it, to contact me.

**What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?**

There is a lot of emphasis placed on user-centered design now. Websites that have a lot of tasks need to be pleasant and effiecient to attract users and websites in general have to be able to stand out amongst others.

**What is user experience design and why is it valuable? **

User experience design is designing a website while keeping in mind how a person will feel when interacting with it. This includes taking into consideration the ease of use, utility, and efficiency of the website, as well as accessibility-for people using screen readers, those with slow internet connections, or those with old mobile devices. It is valuable because the userbase of the Web has grown a lot in recent years, but so has the complexity of what websites can do, making it more important that your users can properly enjoy your website.

**Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?**

Making the site map was a bit tedious. I can see the benefit when you have a website with a lot going on, with subpages for each main page and the like, but for what is (at this point in time) a fairly simple website it doesn't seem as beneficial. Still, I understand that it's a good idea to get into the habit from the start.
