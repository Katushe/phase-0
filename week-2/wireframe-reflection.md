**What is a wireframe?**

A wireframe is a diagram of what you would like your website to look like. Before you start actually building a website, you plan out the layout and how users will interact with the website. It can be a rough handdrawn sketch, or there are mutiple tools, both online and downloadable software, that can help.

**What are the benefits of wireframing?**

A wireframe causes you to think about and plan out what your site will look like before you get into writing out the html/css for it. Also, wireframes are usually black & white, so you focus more on the layout and navigation for your site without getting bogged down in the details like color and fonts. A wireframe can be helpful if you're designing a website for someone else, as breaking it down into separate steps like this allows you to gather feedback at different stages and keeps you from getting too far into the process and then discovering that your client doesn't like the foundation.

**Did you enjoy wireframing your site?**

This is the first time I've wireframed a website, so it was fun. I enjoyed playing around with the different tools available and trying to figure out which one I liked best. I focused on the free & online ones available, but I would like to try out some of the downloadable software in the future.

**Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?**

My revising was mostly done in-process. While playing around with all the different options and just figuring out how the wireframing websites worked, I moved things around until I found a configuration I liked

**What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?**

I wanted to get some ideas for the layout, so I looked up templates for "resume/personal" sites as well as templates for blog sites to get some inspiration.

**Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?**

I didn't find any of it tedious, I enjoyed all of it. Probably because it was a novelty for me, so all the different aspects of the wireframing tools were new and figuring them out was interesting.
