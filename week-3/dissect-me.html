          Version control is the process of keeping a history of the changes you make to your code. With version control, you keep different versions of your code throughout the stages of development. Version control gives you a safety net, as a lot of things can go wrong when trying to build something, and your ideas for your project can change as you are working on it. If you change something that breaks your code, you can easily go back to a previous still-functioning version of your code. In some cases, this can be faster and less frustrating than working backwards through your code trying to fix it (and possibly introducing more bugs in the process). If you decide you actually don't want to include one of the features you added to your project, or you want to rework it in a completely different way, you can easily go back to an earlier version of your project before you added that functionality, and work forward from there. Furthermore, version control systems like git prompt you to make note of changes when you are saving your code, which means you can go back and have a clear idea of how your project evolved. Version control also makes it easier to work in a team, as it allows people to work on the same files and then merge their work together without overwriting each other's work.

          Git is one of various version control software that you install locally on your computer. You can then use it to track the changes you make to your files. When you alert Git of the files you would like it to keep track of, when you later ask for the status of your project, it will tell you which files have been modified, which can be helpful on a project with many files that you are constantly adding to. Git will also inform you of any files within that project that you have not explicitly told it to track. Using git, you can "commit" your files, or save a current version of them, and the tracking from earlier can remind you of what has changed so that you can make note of it.

          While git is software you install on your computer, GitHub is a website where you can upload your all the files from your projects. It is always a good idea to have backups of your projects, and GitHub allows you to have (free!) remote backups of everything on the internet. If you ever have any issues on your local machine, you can easily recover it from GitHub. It also makes it easier to work collaboratively - everyone on your team can have access to the project on GitHub and it facilitates uploading/downloading each others' changes. Another cool thing is that it can function as a sort of social media site. Most projects on GitHub are public (though if you have a paid account you can make them private) which means anyone can look over your project and offer suggestions and/or work on changes on their own and then propose you add them (don't worry, they can't directly make any changes to your code without your permission).

<!--
What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
  I used main here and I use it a lot to signify the main content of a page. I've used article quite a few times so separate something that stands on its own. I've also added headers and footers to most of the pages I've worked on so far.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
  HTML works like a tree. First it displays the top-level elements, then moves through the nested elements like moving through branches in a tree.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
  I did not know snippets were a thing-even the built in one that gives you a skeleton when you type in "html", so that was a new thing I learned. I will definitely create more in the future if I notice that there are bits of code that I keep using over and over again
